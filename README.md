# Graph101
Hi, I will be storing all graph related concepts, their code and standard good conceptual question's logic in Hinglish. So, it will be easy for anyone to understand and revise (:
Do star it to let me know, if you find it useful. I will appreaciate that a lot. 

PS:- I learnt Graphs from striver's Utube, he is a great guy do check his utube channel as well. ( he was my interviewer at m.net :0, from there only I came to know about him )
